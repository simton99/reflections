What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need to do it.
It sets up the structure of the repository which allows you to create all the commits that you need.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area contains only the files from the working directory that are to be included in the commit to the repository. It adds value by providing a clearly identifiable way of adding only the files you want to the commit.
